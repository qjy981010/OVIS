<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>Current developments in temporal event or action localization usually target actions captured by a single camera. However, extensive events or actions in the wild may be captured as a sequence of shots by multiple cameras at different positions. 
In this paper, we propose a new and challenging task called multi-shot temporal event localization, and accordingly, collect a large scale dataset called <strong>MUlti-Shot EventS (MUSES)</strong>. MUSES has <strong>31,477</strong> event instances for a total of <strong>716</strong> video hours. The core nature of MUSES is the frequent shot cuts, for an average of <strong>19</strong> shots per instance and <strong>176</strong> shots per video, which induces large intra-instance variations. Our comprehensive evaluations show that the state-of-the-art method in temporal action localization only achieves an mAP of 13.1% at IoU=0.5. As a minor contribution, we present a simple baseline approach for handling the intra-instance variations, which reports an mAP of 18.9% on MUSES and 56.9% on THUMOS14 at IoU=0.5. To facilitate research in this direction, we release the dataset and the project code.</p>

<p>What’s included in MUSES:</p>
<ul>
  <li>3,697 videos of TV and movie dramas</li>
  <li>716 hours of duration</li>
  <li>25 event categories</li>
  <li>652k shots</li>
  <li>31,477 annotated event instances</li>
</ul>

<p>In each video, we annotate all event instances with temporal boundaries and categories. On average, there are 3.3 categories and 8.5 instances per video.</p>

<h2 id="multi-shot-events">Multi-Shot Events</h2>
<p>A unique characteristic of MUSES, which collects TV and movie dramas, is the highly frequent shot cuts. Herein,
a shot means a single sequence of video frames taken by
one camera without interruption1. Because of the use of
multi-camera shooting and professional editing techniques,
a complete action or event in such videos is usually expressed
as a sequence of meaningful short shots connected by cuts of various types, such as direct cuts, cut-ins, cut-outs
and dissolves.</p>

<!-- ## Categories
The 25 categories are as follows -->

<p>The key challenge of localizing events in
TV shows and movies is the large <strong>intra-instance variation</strong>,
induced by the nature of shot cuts. As can be observed in
Fig. 2, the view angles and the depth of fields across shots
vary dramatically. Meanwhile, due to the existence of shot
cuts, some side effects occur, such as scene change, actor
change, and heavy occlusions. With such large variations
within a single instance, the difficulty of localizing a complete
event across shots is significantly increased.</p>

illustration. The scissor icons indicate the shot boundaries.</i></center>

<h2 id="categories">Categories</h2>
<p>The 25 event categories in MUSES are <i>conversation,
quarrel, crying, fight, drinking, eating, telephone conversation,
horse riding, hugging, stroll, driving, chasing, gunfight,
modern meeting, speech, ancient meeting, kissing,
war, playing an instrument, dance, (human) flying, cooking,
singing, bike riding</i>, and <i>desk work</i>.</p>

<!-- # Wiki
In the production of movies and TV shows, multiple cameras are often used to shoot a scene at different positions. A continuous view filmed by one camera without interruption is called a **shot**. During editing, selected shots will be joined to depict a continous **event**. Transition from one shot to another is called a **cut**. -->
